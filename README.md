# JavaScript Linked Lists

In Computer Science, one of the most basic and fundamental data structures is the linked list. This project provides a functional programming approach to implementing linked lists in JavaScript.

## Structure

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements called nodes that "point" to the next node by means of a pointer. Each node holds a single element of data and a link or pointer to the next node in the list.
